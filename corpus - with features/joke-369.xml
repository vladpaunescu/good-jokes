    <title type="str">Toupee Joke</title>

    <content type="str">Ted was going bald there was no two ways about it. Trying to cheer him up his wife Barbara bought him a toupee.
Barbara was very excited to show off her “new husband”, so she was thrilled when one of their friends invited them to a party at their house.
It was later that night after the party that Barbara found Ted lounging around on the couch looking depressed.
“What’s wrong Honey?” said Barbara sitting down on the couch next to him.
“I didn’t enjoy the party at all,” complained Ted “I was so self conscious I felt like everyone was able to tell I was wearing a toupee.
“Oh Sweety” said Barbara patting Ted’s knee, “I’m sure nobody was able to tell!
In fact all of the people  at the party that I told, were all surprised!”
