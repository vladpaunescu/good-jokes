    <title type="str">Back Seat Driver Joke</title>
    <url type="str">http://www.greatcleanjokes.com/2512/back-seat-driver-joke/</url>
    <content type="str">My daughter sure showed me what a back seat driver I am!  On our way to the mall today, I stopped short at a red light causing the car to jolt.  As soon as I jerked my 3 year old in the back seat hollered Daaaaave.  Not sure why she had called my husband’s name, I asked her why she had said what she did.  ”That’s what you say when someone stops like that”, she innocently replied.
