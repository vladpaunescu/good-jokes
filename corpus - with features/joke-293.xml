    <content type="str">“Oh no! not leftovers again!” complained my older sister when she saw the leftover meatloaf on the table from last nights supper.
“Young lady” responded my father sternly, “do you know how many people would love to have a delicious supper like this?! You should be ashamed of yourself! Now before we start eating I want to hear you say grace thanking the Lord for this delicious meal!”
“Thank you Lord for this delicious supper”, muttered my sister submissively “….again!”
