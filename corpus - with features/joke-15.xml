    <content type="str">Edward was lying on his deathbed and the family was taking turns spending time with him.    As he was speaking to his young granddaughter Emily, Edward suddenly smelled an all too familiar smell.  Why it was his favorite – apple pie!  His wife Sandy must have been baking it for him to enjoy this one last time.  “Emily dear,” asked Edward.  “Would you please go ask Grandma for a slice of that Apple Pie?  It’s smells so delicious!”  Emily ran off to fulfill her dying Grandfather’s last wish.  A moment later, Emily returned empty handed.  “Where’s my pie?”  questioned Edward.  “Grandma said it’s not for now” responded Emily, “it’s for the funeral”.
