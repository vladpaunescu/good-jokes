    <content type="str">Eddy was just a regular guy. Except for the fact that he was an only child and the fact that his billionaire father was breathing his last. 
Since Eddy was a soon to be billionaire  it only made sense that he should have a woman to share his riches with. Eddy approached his childhood crush. “Hey Sandra, I may look like a regular guy, but I’m soon gonna be a billionaire! Do you wanna come home with me?”
“Sure thing” Sandra replied, “I would love to come home with you.” 
And that’s the story how Sandra became Eddie’s Stepmother.
