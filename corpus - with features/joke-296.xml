    <content type="str">Sandy and Norman were in despair.  Their 3 year old son Timmy still had not learned how to talk.  Not a word had escaped through those now 3 year old lips.  One night at dinner, Timmy took a taste of his pie, and to their utter surprise and amazement, said: “You call this pie?  It tastes like some tasteless mush!”.  Sandy and Norman sat there in shock, for this was not just their son’s first sentence, but the first words he ever uttered!  Once the initial shock had subsided, Norman asked “tell me Timmy, how come you never spoke until now?”  “I never had any reason to” explained Timmy.  “Everything was always fine.”
