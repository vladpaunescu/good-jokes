    <title type="str">Is Goat Food Kosher?</title>
    <url type="str">http://www.greatcleanjokes.com/411/is-goat-food-kosher/</url>
    <content type="str">I was at a children’s zoo with my children happily feeding the goats when I noticed a toddler shoving the pellets into his mouth. Scared that it could be dangerous I ran over to stop him, but before I could get there I heard his mother scolding him “Don’t eat those they’re not kosher“  -Julie Kornfeld
