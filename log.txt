DaniilConstantin-wiki: joins the room
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: joins the room
Andrei Stanciu - forum: joins the room
Flavius Padina: joins the room
Flavius Padina: leaves the room
Flavius Padina - blog: joins the room
BobricIleana - chat: joins the room
DaniilConstantin-wiki: so, we are all here. welcome team
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Hello everyone!
BobricIleana - chat: Hello!
Flavius Padina - blog: hello
Andrei Stanciu - forum: hey team
Andrei Stanciu - forum: are we all ready ?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: What do we have in schedule for today?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I see that our company has been very successful this year, but in order to keep our position we have to usebettertechnologiesfor everyday tasks and communication
BobricIleana - chat: we'll have to establish the technologies we will use from now on, so, where do we start?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: fair enough
DaniilConstantin-wiki: there are many things we can consider: wikis, google wave, forums, blogs, chat and many more
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Let's begin with the description of our project
DaniilConstantin-wiki: well, our software company has produced many applications for mobile phones and other mobile devices. so far we have many satisfied customers and employees, but we needmore
Andrei Stanciu - forum: ok, so basicly we need to add some ways for our emplyess to comunicate better, in order to increase our productivity
DaniilConstantin-wiki: exactly, one of the essential things we need is good collaboration between our staff members, and that includes everything from chit-chat to technical details
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ok and in order to do this we need to use the best technologies.
BobricIleana - chat: and to improve our customer service support
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You are all right
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I propose to start by talking about the chat
BobricIleana - chat: i agree
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: What can you say about this Ileana?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: ok. that is indeed essentail
BobricIleana - chat: it is a good techonolgy to obtain a real time conversation between out employees, this way they could decide and colaborate together easier
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i think the chat application is essential actualy
Flavius Padina - blog: but it'shard to keep a history
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and due to the numerous chat programs, it shouldn't cost us anything to implement
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes you are right and we can use it for fast communication between our staff
BobricIleana - chat: we could provide a chat with more rooms, including a global one for the entire company, and also more roomsfor different departments
Andrei Stanciu - forum: but not the "room" type, we need an instant messaging app.used fo 1on1
DaniilConstantin-wiki: not necessarily, if we use a smart chat program that saves our logs and then we store them in a database
BobricIleana - chat: we could have both
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I propose to use Skype for this. It is very profi :)
DaniilConstantin-wiki: the issues that need to be considered here are speed and security
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well.. i dont know about that dragos
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i mean, we should develop our own softwer
BobricIleana - chat: yes, and the database could be accessed by member using theyr id and password. this way we providesecurity also
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that's my oppinion though
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I agree. that way we can have complete control of the application and upgrade it as we see fit
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I think it is not a good point because that takes a lot of time to develop and there are many tools to do this
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and we dont depend on other servers than our own
Flavius Padina - blog: i agree with andrei, we should implement only what we need for chat
BobricIleana - chat: skype could be annoying if everybody starts talking in a department
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well, a lot of time or not, it is important to be in complete control
Andrei Stanciu - forum: the skype servers could fail at some point, or they could be experiencing lag issues
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we must not have to deal with that kind of problems
DaniilConstantin-wiki: since we have many talented engineers and programmers we can easily take what is good from other chat programs and add to our own
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I agree
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree to with this point of view, but timeis also important for us
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Why not use something that is available
DaniilConstantin-wiki: We should give our employees privileges, and they will be able to make private / public chat rooms, invite others to chat, create conferences, use voice over IP, most things that a good chat program offers
BobricIleana - chat: it is, indeed, but we could spare a little timeto make a goodproductthat would be specific for our needs
DaniilConstantin-wiki: like ?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well, that may be, but in let's say, a year, we will wish we had spent a bit more time on a more reliableapplication
DaniilConstantin-wiki: what would you suggest we use that would offer all the advantages we need
DaniilConstantin-wiki: ?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Like any other chat programme: GTalk,Skype even messanger. They all have what you mentioned befonre
Flavius Padina - blog: and they are relaible too
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We do not want to invent the weel when someone allready done it
BobricIleana - chat: we could also concern about their policy, a chat like that would not be totally private to us
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I don't think being dependant on other servers is such a good idea. besides there are known flaws when it comes to security: for example how can you be truly invisible
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree with you. You will never see these servers down
BobricIleana - chat: but we wouldn't reinvent it actually, but adapt it
Andrei Stanciu - forum: also, remember about privacy, if we develop our own chat, we can use it only in LAN, and then we can encript the communication between LANs as we see fit
Andrei Stanciu - forum: privacy and information
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I totally agree with that suggestion
Andrei Stanciu - forum: security*
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and you have to admit yahoo and google accounts can be hacked in numerous ways
DaniilConstantin-wiki: you would be putting our clients' information at risk
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You cannot intercept for example Yahoo chat conversation I've tryed it and it doesn't work
DaniilConstantin-wiki: there are other better hackers out there :), and, like I said, an account can easily be hacked
BobricIleana - chat: plus, it's better to make our chat because we can create our own specific rooms, rooms that aren't available in an application like skype
Flavius Padina - blog: we could implement other technologies that are more usefull then chat
BobricIleana - chat: but yahoocan
DaniilConstantin-wiki: exactly
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: What do you suggest Flavius?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: also think about other problemsthat come with public chat applications, like spamming flooding and such
BobricIleana - chat: useful for what?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and also, we should havecompletecontrolon who our emplyees are able to talk to
Flavius Padina - blog: for our company
DaniilConstantin-wiki: The best thing to do, considering our elaborate employee database, is to create a chat program implementing the most common technologies that would be used internally
DaniilConstantin-wiki: We can easily asses the costs and advantages and make a decision
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree with you on security, but on a chat you do not givetop secret information.
BobricIleana - chat: yes, and if we have time problems, we could offer a bonus for the employees that stay over time and implement that chat application
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can use it to announce events, meetings, tasks etc
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well, top secret... is a bit.. dramatic, but there may be some sensitivedata
DaniilConstantin-wiki: sometimes you do, that's why security is important
DaniilConstantin-wiki: if a chat program is well made, that will not be an issue. that's why we need to make our own program
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and there are many other ways to do that :)
BobricIleana - chat: but employeescould use it to colaborate on different projects etc, this would be bad if the source codes would be given to other companyes
Andrei Stanciu - forum: all in all, there are lots of downsides to public chatting apps. you have spam, flood, employees may get distracted easily, lower security,
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ok if you want to use this application in this scope we can make an internal one, but I mentioned earlier we have to think about time. A good and stable application takes time and our clients do not want us to waste it
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that problem is common in our field, but we havesmartsecurity measures at the office that prevent employees from doing that
BobricIleana - chat: like i said earlier, we could find a way to deal with time
DaniilConstantin-wiki: how else do you think we have stayed in business :)
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: For this part I suggest something better like Goggle Wave or a SVN
DaniilConstantin-wiki: chat would be excellent for meeting, discussion and other such topics, but we needmore. We have to admit that, since we use a lot of different technologies and even create our own programs, we need a good way to keep them organized. a wiki is ideal for this
Andrei Stanciu - forum: or better yet, if time is a problem, we could simply buy such an app
BobricIleana - chat: true, but if we would use a public application, like messenger, that would be a security breach
DaniilConstantin-wiki: project can be created with wave and the technology behind them can be documented in a wiki
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree with you on this. Good idea!
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that's why our own chat program is the best idea
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Let's go on what Andrei suggested
BobricIleana - chat: ok, so do we all agree to make our own chat application?
BobricIleana - chat: guess not :))
DaniilConstantin-wiki: we will assess the costs. it may be better if we develop it ourselves cause we will have complete control over the code
DaniilConstantin-wiki: then again, if time is truly a problem, we can buy on and update that
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that is not a problem, if we decide to buy software, there are lots of companies that specialise in creating custom apps, that meet specific requirements
DaniilConstantin-wiki: you mentioned wave for our projects
BobricIleana - chat: and i don't think time would be such a big problem, because we don't have to develop a complicated application
Andrei Stanciu - forum: so we can get pretty much anything we need
DaniilConstantin-wiki: do you think it can offer us everything we need for our many different departments
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes Constantin. Because we talked about internal communication, now let's talk about sharing code, documents etc
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well, yes, because they work based on our specifications
Flavius Padina - blog: I think that a program like wave will give us an advantege because we can use it and olso sell it
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: For thos we need an application like Google Wave that does all these things for us.
BobricIleana - chat: but before we do that, let's establish what are we going to do with chat, are we going to buy it or develop it ourselves? i say we make it, who else does?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: there are many ways to do that. google wave is indeed good for code and document sharing, and with a good wiki behind it where all the raw technical general data will be documented, our employees will be well organized
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we could develop it ourselves, after all time is not such a big issue in this matter, our company worked well enough without a chat so far, it can go on for a bit longer without one
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes we can use both for Specifications, tasks, schedules etc
DaniilConstantin-wiki: We will assess the situation. If time is short we will buy an application and then upgrade it when need arises. If we have time we will develop it ourselves
Andrei Stanciu - forum: fair enough
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree with you on this
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that is excellent for our needs. is there an upload limit, as in a limit to the information we can put on their servers?
BobricIleana - chat: ok
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: No, the guys at Google are very generous with this stuff and is practically no limit
DaniilConstantin-wiki: what about security problems?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: And I think that goes the same for wikis
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Every user has an account and you can make a wave public only to a part of them. We do not need the HR to know what the Dev Department is doing
BobricIleana - chat: very well. and, is there a way to provide authentication for certain documents etc? some employees shouldn't be able to see all that's been shared
BobricIleana - chat: 
DaniilConstantin-wiki: exactly. a wiki is perfect for our technical needs. also, theyprovide a good way to keep our information organized and give us excellent security, cause we can decide who can and can't see the different articles
BobricIleana - chat: and that answers my question :P
Flavius Padina - blog: ok, what about real time?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I'm guessing we use google accounts ?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: what exactly do you plan on using wikis for ?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i was thinking they could be usefull for sharing information with the public
Andrei Stanciu - forum: like maybe having tutorials, specification, and things like that published
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You are right. You can make one for every user and it is free
Flavius Padina - blog: this goes better on a blog
BobricIleana - chat: could they be a way to share/ technical documentation for our employees?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: we use a lot of different technologies and even create some of our own. a wiki would be an excellent way to gather them all in one place. that way our employees will have a great online database to check whenever they have a problem
BobricIleana - chat: i agree with you on this
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that is excellent. and I'm guessing, since Google made it, the interface is smartly made and our employees will adjust to it easily
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i think that would be a bit confusing... after all, we have the technical department for issues like that
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ok let's make a review now.
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We will use waves for tasks, meetings, schedules etc
DaniilConstantin-wiki: it is rather pointless for our staff to keep going to the technical department for most issues that they could look up for themselves, if they had a wiki
BobricIleana - chat: if an employee need to access some documentation on an earlier release of a product, he shouldn't have to go to the technical department to solve it
DaniilConstantin-wiki: can we also use it to planourprojects ?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: the documentation is available in the databases
DaniilConstantin-wiki: exactly
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I suggest a wiki is good for documentation and requirements of projects
Andrei Stanciu - forum: should he need et, he only has to open it
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i highly disagree
DaniilConstantin-wiki: not all of it. besides it is a lot easier to search a wiki then a database
BobricIleana - chat: and also for technicals debates between employees
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Of course we can use it
Andrei Stanciu - forum: wikis, by deffinition, are made for public wide use
DaniilConstantin-wiki: all major companies have wikis for their technologies. most people like to search wikis cause they provide accurate and easy to access information. Also, that way ourdatabase serverswon't be so used
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You are wrong here, Costa can tell us more
Andrei Stanciu - forum: yes, they have wikis that are publicly available, with public information, for the everyday user that takes an intrest in that company's products
DaniilConstantin-wiki: not necessarily. we can restrict access to certain articles. that way our wiki will have some sections for the general public who want to find out some details about our technologies (what we are willing to share, of course) and some just for our employees
BobricIleana - chat: then we could have to types of wikis, public and private
Andrei Stanciu - forum: our employees need not read articles, they need a quick way to get to certain documents
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can use a wweb site or a blog for doing that Andrei.
DaniilConstantin-wiki: besides there is no way that you can structure a database to make information easier to access that a wiki
Flavius Padina - blog: i agree with you and we also can post news or updates for our proucts
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: A wiki is not good for our clients. We need something with richer content, more attractive....
BobricIleana - chat: this way, we can interact with our customers, see what they think of our products, what they like and what they need
DaniilConstantin-wiki: We can include that information in a wiki too. but I agree with Dragos's suggestion. Besides, the main purpose of our wiki would be to include technical details
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Can we customize a blog to make it look very nice ?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: That would be excellent. Having up to date information is the hallmark of a successful company
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Exactly, only tehnical information for our emplyees
Flavius Padina - blog: I think we should use wiki for us and a blog for customers
Andrei Stanciu - forum: what kind of techincal information are you refering to ?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: A blog or web-site is idea for day to day clients, the wiki can be accessed for those who want to find out more technical information about our company. sort of like application developers for Iphone want to find out more information about IOS
Andrei Stanciu - forum: exactly !
DaniilConstantin-wiki: everything from the technologies we use to those we implement. products and components, software programs, you name it
DaniilConstantin-wiki: yup
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that is what i have been saying this whole time
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: For example our projects need requirements that we receive from our clients. The developers need to have fast access to it as well as the QA to test if these requirements are implemented
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we can't we just handle those requirements directly to the employees working on that project ?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: That raises another problem. We need a way for the customers to contact us easily
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and one other thing, we will definetely need an internal mailing client
BobricIleana - chat: but we also needto find out what customers need and want
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: It is not a good point, because requirements change in time. There are added more or deleted.
BobricIleana - chat: a blog is friendly and a good interface for the public
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can use a google wave to keep track of them. What do you say team?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: indeed. and so many people are used to them, it will be good for our clients
Andrei Stanciu - forum: by the way, our site will definetely need some king of forum
DaniilConstantin-wiki: That would be excellent. That way they wouldn't take up extra space on our servers.
Andrei Stanciu - forum: best way to keep track of the clients needs / complains
DaniilConstantin-wiki: definitely
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: That is what I suggested before
BobricIleana - chat: a forum could be very usefull for our technical support team
Andrei Stanciu - forum: also, our technical support teamwill be ableto offer quick solutions to any problem people might have
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Correct
DaniilConstantin-wiki: we could also make a forumfor customers, one only for paying clients where we could solvetheirproblems and one for the staff members
BobricIleana - chat: and we could also include a chat for that, if a client has more complex problems, he could be able to talk to one of our support technicians for solving it
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i dont think it's so important to have one for staff members, since they will have the chat and mail to communicate to each other
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and many people find over 50% of the answers they seek on different forums
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Why should we use a forum for our stuff? We use a chat for that.
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that may be true
Flavius Padina - blog: we can have somebody to answer their problems 24/7
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i dont think its necesary, if they have more complex problems, we have custommer support service via phone
DaniilConstantin-wiki: indeed. that would indeed give the company a very good reputation
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes and we can use a forum for that. The problems will be very organized and if someone has the same problem he will just have to search for it
BobricIleana - chat: but sometimes phonecould beexpensive, think of our customers from other countryes
Flavius Padina - blog: but i don't thinka forumis needed for our staff
DaniilConstantin-wiki: but still, although answering problems by phone is good, having a support teamready 24/7 (with different people depending on the time interval of course) is a good idea
DaniilConstantin-wiki: after seeing your arguments I totally agree.
Andrei Stanciu - forum: yes, i just dont think a chat for this is highly needed
Andrei Stanciu - forum: most likely, a simple forum will do just fine
BobricIleana - chat: if it's not highly needed, it sure looks good on us
BobricIleana - chat: it's always good to give people more alternatives
DaniilConstantin-wiki: like Ileana said, it may be useful for customers from other countries. But still, a forumisa must. After all, that way problems that require some time to solve will never be forgotten; and the customer will know where to expect the answer
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: and the information will be well structured for other use
Andrei Stanciu - forum: but think of anotherproblem, what if it gets over-used, how many people will we need to stay chatting? think that we have milions of custommers
BobricIleana - chat: also it would spare some people time and money, if they search for their problem instead of calling already
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Like I said, a forums is excellent for solving problems, cause that way a customer who has had a similar problems will find the result easily.
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we need something that can help our techincal support team answer as fast as they can, but a chatwill require them to answer on the spot ! and if they are not available.. there goes our image down
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes that is what I have suggested. A chat 24/7 needs more stuff and more money
Andrei Stanciu - forum: its just an unnecesary risk
DaniilConstantin-wiki: but having a chatoption in which limited number of customerscould have live chats with ourstaff regarding technicalproblemsisn't impossible
Andrei Stanciu - forum: precisely
Flavius Padina - blog: this is true
BobricIleana - chat: we won't need that many, probably most of the solutions a slient needs can be found in the forum, but for some exceptions, the chatcould providethe rest of the support
DaniilConstantin-wiki: quite
Andrei Stanciu - forum: a simple forum, a contact phone number, and an email will sufice i belive
Flavius Padina - blog: evreybody will ask on the chat because it will be easier
DaniilConstantin-wiki: all major companies have that and it is indeed sufice
DaniilConstantin-wiki: but there will be a waitingqueue, of course, so many will prefer the forums
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Good point. I have never seen tech support on a chat.
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: :)
BobricIleana - chat: and we could also have a way to tell the clients how may techniciansare available
Andrei Stanciu - forum: yea, people are so lazy, if they can do something to avoid searching on a forum, or waiting for a response on the mail.. they will do that
Flavius Padina - blog: it's way better with just forum and phone
BobricIleana - chat: and cheaper than phone
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and of the wiki is smartly made, some of the more experiencedusers (not necessarily customers but developers) would also findinformation there
Andrei Stanciu - forum: fair enough
BobricIleana - chat: but, it's also easier to look in forum before chat
DaniilConstantin-wiki: indeed, but just a contactemail for businessopportunities for example is ok
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes we can add a Q&A section on the wiki.
BobricIleana - chat: it could be like that policy on forums, if a topic is already open on this debate, nobody will answer... that works with chat too, if the problem has a solution on forum, nobody will answer in chat
Andrei Stanciu - forum: but still, you will needpeopleto check the chat
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and im sure, there will be milions of requests to check
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ileana do you agree that a chat is not a good idea?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: an excellent idea, and if a problem if very common we will just highlight a certain thread, or pin it as it is called
BobricIleana - chat: well, our soft could do that for them, it could search the forum topics and see if the chat topic matches any of them
DaniilConstantin-wiki: maybe not millions, give our programmers more credit :)
Flavius Padina - blog: but the userwill whait for the answer and will get mad whent he won't get it and we can lose this customer
Andrei Stanciu - forum: than it would be more like a search engine. and the forum will already have one
BobricIleana - chat: ow well... since nobody wants it ... i won't insist anymore
Andrei Stanciu - forum: exactly
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Why use a chat topic? We can use a forum topic. In a forum other users can answer to similar problems and get answers
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I agree. a good search engine is the key to success, wheatear we are talking about a forums, blog, database, wiki or even web-site
Andrei Stanciu - forum: having a chat, is making a promise, that they will get a quick answer. and if we cant do that, it will look bad. better not to take the risk
BobricIleana - chat: ok then, maybe discuss it in a future conference? :)
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that depends, if we have a queue and the customer will see the number of people in front of him, he will estimate what to do
Flavius Padina - blog: we all agree that for the moment the forum is the best way to solve problemes
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes and all the arguments are in favour
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Yes, and a blog + web-site the best way to give customers up-to-date information
BobricIleana - chat: i didn't say we shouldn't have a forum, i totally agree that is the basic solution for this
BobricIleana - chat: i just think that if we already consider a chat for our employees, why not for our customers too?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: we will use wave and wiki for "project management" and technical details
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: a google wave for internal meetings and tasks
DaniilConstantin-wiki: and we will have a chat program for our employees to use inside the company
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and also remember we will need an internalmailingclient
BobricIleana - chat: and a forum for technical support
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we could incorporate that in the chat application, or have an independent one
Andrei Stanciu - forum: but i suggest incorporating it with the chat, it makes for easier use i think
DaniilConstantin-wiki: But what about securitypolicies. We need to establish clear policies about user accounts. Having a lot of applications will require a lot of accounts from each and every employee
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Outlook is a great tool for emails
Andrei Stanciu - forum: dragos, you have to agree that any self-respected company has their own internal mailing client
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Indeed and if we buy many licenses we will get an advantageous discount
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can use the same user names+passwords for all of these applications.
BobricIleana - chat: we should also have a wayto control what emailscan go out of the company
Andrei Stanciu - forum: thats why internal mail is good
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You are wronh here mail server not client
BobricIleana - chat: we don't want important documents to be sold to the competition
Andrei Stanciu - forum: no company related information can be sent outside
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Correct
BobricIleana - chat: ahh, ok
DaniilConstantin-wiki: On one hand that is a terrific idea cause our staff won't be overwhelmed with data to remember yet on the other hand having one password for all these accounts is a security risk
Flavius Padina - blog: not if we change it weekly or somting like that
BobricIleana - chat: i don't think our smart and good employees will have problems remembering their passwords
DaniilConstantin-wiki: We should at least make it compulsory to change passwords every month or so
BobricIleana - chat: yes, that is a great idea
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I was thinking at the same thing
DaniilConstantin-wiki: oh sorry. you took the words out of my mouth :D
BobricIleana - chat: and  also  force them to usespecialcharacters and digits too 
DaniilConstantin-wiki: great idea
DaniilConstantin-wiki: exactly
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ileana the user is the weekest link in security
Andrei Stanciu - forum: haha, true
BobricIleana - chat: true, but if they can't  remember a password, they can find it by asking the tech guys
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that reminds me, we need administers for all the new technologies
Andrei Stanciu - forum: the network administrators can do that
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: The IT department will take care of that
DaniilConstantin-wiki: we can use a person or a team of people to handle the wiki posts, forums posts, wave documents and all the other important stuff
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes
DaniilConstantin-wiki: the only problem that still remains is that we need someone to check wiki articles, blog and forums posts so that classified data does not accidentally reach a "public" area
Flavius Padina - blog: and another team for internel comuniction and security
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can use filters for that firewalls. That can save some money
DaniilConstantin-wiki: saving money is always an excellent idea :)
BobricIleana - chat:  but how can you  use a filter for a forum? 
Andrei Stanciu - forum: well, mainly the tech dept. guys will do that, and i think we can count on them knowing what they are doing
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i dont think they will accidentaly post source codes :)
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can add a database of private key words that do not have to go to the customers.
DaniilConstantin-wiki: besides reading the posts, we can have restricted key-words (we can check our database and forbid staff members from posting certain data)
DaniilConstantin-wiki: once again someone beat me to the punch :D
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: :))
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that could prove a bit tricky, since it could get a bit to restrictive
Andrei Stanciu - forum:  but i thinkitcan be done
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: It depends on the planning
BobricIleana - chat: yes, and  also, if someonesells us out, he goes to jail :P 
DaniilConstantin-wiki: although this may seem a clich?, it is better to be restrictive then over permissive :D
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: yes
Andrei Stanciu - forum: or worse, he will get fired :D
BobricIleana - chat: :))
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Exactly
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Apart from the actual development and implementation of these technologies, I don't think much training will be in order
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I mean everyone of our employees knows how to use a wiki, forum blog and chat, and google wave has a extremely friendly interface
BobricIleana - chat: we don't have to train that much our employees to develop these technologies
Flavius Padina - blog: evrybody can use a chat , forum , bog or something like that
DaniilConstantin-wiki: People all over the world edit wiki articles easily so that won't be a problem
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes and google wave has a video tutorial that can help our users. So it is a good starting point
BobricIleana - chat: it  could be harder for the  chat application,  but only for that
DaniilConstantin-wiki: all we have to do is instruct them on the structure and security policy of our applications
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that is excellenty
Flavius Padina - blog: i totally agree with you
DaniilConstantin-wiki: any other imporant technologies we should consider?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: We can also use a SVN for our code. What do you think of this?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I have used it and was very pleased with it
DaniilConstantin-wiki:  also, we can usenumerousprograms for crypting important data
BobricIleana - chat: can you say a bit more about this idea?
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: The SVN uses a local server
Andrei Stanciu - forum: something else, i think, for security resons, we should restrict web access in certain deparments
Andrei Stanciu - forum: like per say, in the develpment areas
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: A svn is an open-source revision control system. Users can work on a version of the application code and commit it. If two users are working on the same thing when they commit a merge is made with the 2 versions
BobricIleana - chat: web access? all the access to internet? why?
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I agree. Every employee will have certain privileges depending of their job or department
Flavius Padina - blog: i don't agree because at certaine point everybody will need web for researche or somtething
DaniilConstantin-wiki: And we can have our own servers, such as an email and SVN
Flavius Padina - blog: else
Andrei Stanciu - forum: because we are talking about sensitive data that could cost us A LOT
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Maybe not certain employees  but certain computers anyway 
Andrei Stanciu - forum: how do you think piracy works? source codes get leacket
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree. People working on different projects don't need access to all of them.
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that's the last thing we need
BobricIleana - chat: i agree with you on this, everybody needs access to different documentation, we can't provide everything for that
DaniilConstantin-wiki: you know what they say, the best protection against sharks is not going into the water at all
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I think we have analyzed the most useful technologies around, let's make a short review and that should cover it
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: So you agree with me?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: i do
BobricIleana - chat: i think a svn is a good idea, we should discuss it again in the future
Andrei Stanciu - forum: the development area should be completely sealed off
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and if somebody needs internet acces, they will have other terminals to use
DaniilConstantin-wiki: yup
BobricIleana - chat:  but what if theyneed to look up for something? 
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes you are right
Andrei Stanciu - forum: other terminals, computers in the same room even
Flavius Padina - blog: i think it's way to restrictive
Andrei Stanciu - forum:  but the computersused for development should be cut of from the outside world
DaniilConstantin-wiki: they will use another machine. the restrictions will be only for certain computers
Flavius Padina - blog: this is a better idea then "sealing" a departament
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Ok, so we will use chat and google wave for project and activity management
BobricIleana - chat: this could make them loose time...
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I agree with you, niot all departments interact
DaniilConstantin-wiki: yup
BobricIleana - chat:  but if you all think this is the only way to provide the security we need, then i won't complain
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Can you give more details?
Andrei Stanciu - forum: that is a bit far-fetched, we are talking maybe about a few minutes lost a day
DaniilConstantin-wiki: quite
BobricIleana - chat: well...shifting computers for small things
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: You are right we should look at the big picture
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I agree that may be costly,  but we  will only restrict the access of certaincomputers
Andrei Stanciu - forum: they shouldn't need anything from the web, we provide anything they need
BobricIleana - chat: for every function you don't remember in a programming language, you will have to move to other computer to find out...  but it'sok ... it wouldn't be a big problem i guess
Flavius Padina - blog: not necesarly computers,you can change acounts
DaniilConstantin-wiki: even better. excellent idea
Flavius Padina - blog: on the same computer with different data and internet access
Andrei Stanciu - forum: we have pros, with years of experience, that shouldn't happen very often
Andrei Stanciu - forum: and i think it is worth, since it could save us A LOT of money
BobricIleana - chat: that's true :)
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ok let's sum up.
DaniilConstantin-wiki: indeed
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: I want everyone to say why their technology should be used
DaniilConstantin-wiki: so we will use wave and chat for internal affairs such as project management, activity planning and collaboration
DaniilConstantin-wiki: a wiki will be excellent for summing up the technolgoies / products we use or make
BobricIleana - chat: well i think chat is important for our employees, it helps them talk and colaborate, spare time by not meeting in conferences that much, and be on track with all theit colleagues are doing
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: A google wave is the best sollution for time and task management. Moreover it can be used for sharing docs, xls, presentations etc
Andrei Stanciu - forum: ok, and make sure we have a nice-looking site, with a good, well-organised forum, as a first line tech support
Flavius Padina - blog: we should use a blog for posting update and information about products, get opinion from customers and interect with them
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: That is a must have. The way our clients "see" us is most important!
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Indeed. Our companies image will grow if we have a forum, a blog, a wiki and a cool web-site that customers or developers can use
BobricIleana - chat: and that will also be the blog's function too 
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I totally agree. Image is important
Andrei Stanciu - forum: in these thays, they are more important than the actual products :)
Flavius Padina - blog: and we should use some plubicity for our products.the customers should know about them
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Ok guys and girls I think that covers all the points of our debate
BobricIleana - chat: so, this was a very productive meeting, i think we settled enough for today :)
DaniilConstantin-wiki: that can be done in many way, no problem there :)
DaniilConstantin-wiki: indeed
DaniilConstantin-wiki: I foresee a very productive year for our company
Andrei Stanciu - forum: sure hope so
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Hope so too
BobricIleana - chat: i'm sure all these will improve and help our company grow
DaniilConstantin-wiki: Guess that wrap's everything up. Have a nice day team
Flavius Padina - blog: see you on the next meeting with new ideas
DaniilConstantin-wiki: leaves the room
Andrei Stanciu - forum: good night guys, this went quite well
BobricIleana - chat: 
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Yes. Have a nice day too!
BobricIleana - chat: good night everyone, and thank you for your collaboration:)
Flavius Padina - blog: good night
Andrei Stanciu - forum: leaves the room
Flavius Padina - blog: leaves the room
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Thank you too Ileana for your ideas
BobricIleana - chat: leaves the room
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: Bye
Dragos_Diosteanu-wave: leaves the room
