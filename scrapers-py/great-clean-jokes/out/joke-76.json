Moment’s before the guests were scheduled to arrive, she asked Tom if he would be ever so gracious to walk a block down to the beach to pick up some fresh snails for the party.  On his way to the beach he passed the local bar, and figured he’d stop in for a quick drink before heading down to the beach to search for the snails.  \nOne drink lead to the next, and before he knew it, it was 5:00 in the morning and he hadn’t gotten his wife those snails.  \nQuickly he hurried down to the beach, picked up a few snails, rushed home, and stumbled up the front steps, dropping the snails.  \nAt that moment, his wife angrily opened the door asking him where he had been and how he had ruined her party.  \nTom, looked towards the snails and said “C’mon you slow pokes!  Just a few more steps and we’re there!”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 78, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "127", "category_id": "117", "subcategory_name": "Drunk Jokes", "category_name": "Drunk Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "158", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Husband Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}]}
