A little taken aback, the cop asked to see his license.  “Aw shucks!” cried the man, “I must have left it home!” “Yeah right!” screamed his wife, “You know it expired 3 months ago!”  At a loss for words, the cop asked the woman “are you always so tough on him?!” “No” responded the young woman, “only when he had too much to drink!”.</content><comments_count type="str">0</comments_count><id type="str">81</id><categories type="list"><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">127</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">117</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Drunk Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Drunk Humor</category_name></item><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">162</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">123</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Relationship Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Marriage Humor</category_name></item><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">164</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">123</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Wife Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Marriage Humor</category_name></item></categories></root>
