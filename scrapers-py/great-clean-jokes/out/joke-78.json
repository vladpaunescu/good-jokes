One day in mid winter a drunk stumbled out of the tavern. Due to his drunk state he wasn’t careful where he was going and he fell into a freshly dug grave. “Help!” Screamed the drunk on the top of his lungs, “I’m freezing!”\nBefore long another drunk sauntered out of the tavern and made his way towards the first drunk’s cries. “I’m freezing!” Screamed the first drunk again. \n“Of course you are” scolded the second drunk, coming closer. “You kicked off all of the dirt they had covered you with!”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 79, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "127", "category_id": "117", "subcategory_name": "Drunk Jokes", "category_name": "Drunk Humor"}]}
