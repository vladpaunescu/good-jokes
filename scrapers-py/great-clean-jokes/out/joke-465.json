He was a happy jolly fellow always willing to help or lend a hand. One time John was walking down the street humming a tune when he saw a little boy trying to reach the doorbell of a nearby house.  “Hey there sonny” said John “let me help you out”, and with that  John reached out and pressed the bell. “Anything else I can do for you,” asked John with a smile. “Yes” said the boy. “Run! We’ve only got a few seconds before they come!”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 466, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "173", "category_id": "125", "subcategory_name": "Cute Jokes", "category_name": "People Jokes"}]}
