As he was speaking to his young granddaughter Emily, Edward suddenly smelled an all too familiar smell.  Why it was his favorite – apple pie!  His wife Sandy must have been baking it for him to enjoy this one last time.  “Emily dear,” asked Edward.  “Would you please go ask Grandma for a slice of that Apple Pie?  It’s smells so delicious!”  Emily ran off to fulfill her dying Grandfather’s last wish.
