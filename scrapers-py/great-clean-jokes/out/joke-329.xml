 When his daughter Sandy got engaged to a very religious young man he called the future Groom into his office. 
“So tell me,” said Sam, sitting the young man down. “What are your plans for the future?” 
“Well”, said the Groom. “I plan on studying holy works all of my life.”
“And how exactly do you plan on supporting my daughter if you are studying all day?” questioned Sam. 
“I am sure The Lord will provide.” Answered the young man.
“And what about your kids? How do you plan on supporting them?”
“The Lord will provide” answered the young man again.
“How did it go?” asked Sam’s wife after they finished talking.
“It went great” Sam replied. “I had just met the young fellow and already he thinks I’m the Lord!”
