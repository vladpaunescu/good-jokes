That leaves 133 million to do the work. \nThere are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work. \nOf this there are 29 million employed by the federal government, leaving 19 million to do the work. \n2.8 million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 16.2 million to do the work. \nTake from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City Governments and that leaves 1.4 million to do the work. \nAt any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals, leaving 1,212,000 to do the work. \nNow, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. \nThat leaves just two people to do the work. You and me. \nAnd you’re sitting at your computer reading jokes!\n", "comments_count": 2, "id": 577, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "203", "category_id": "134", "subcategory_name": "Office Jokes", "category_name": "Work Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "204", "category_id": "134", "subcategory_name": "Work Jokes", "category_name": "Work Humor"}]}
