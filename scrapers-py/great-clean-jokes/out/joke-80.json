A little taken aback, the cop asked to see his license.  “Aw shucks!” cried the man, “I must have left it home!” “Yeah right!” screamed his wife, “You know it expired 3 months ago!”  At a loss for words, the cop asked the woman “are you always so tough on him?!” “No” responded the young woman, “only when he had too much to drink!”.", "comments_count": 0, "id": 81, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "127", "category_id": "117", "subcategory_name": "Drunk Jokes", "category_name": "Drunk Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "162", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Relationship Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "164", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Wife Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}]}
