If the employee would mention his lack of ears (which often they did), it would be a for sure “no” for the job.  However if the employee would mention something else, he would hire the guy.  
One year, at the yearly Holiday business party, Bob approached his most recent hireling and asked him if he remembered the last question he had asked him when interviewing him for the job.  “Sure I do” was his reply. “You asked me what was different about you and I said that you were wearing contact lenses.”  “Of all things to answer”, Bob questioned curiously, “why was that the thing you noticed?”  “Well, to be honest, it was quite simple.  How could you possibly be wearing glasses if you don’t have any ears!”
