We’re not really sure what to do with you. Can you tell us anything you did that can help us make a decision?”\nThe newly arrived soul thought for a moment and replied, “Yeah, once I was driving along and came upon a person who was being harassed by a group of thugs. So I pulled over, got out a bat, and went up to the leader of the thugs. He was a big, muscular guy with a ring pierced through his lip. Well, I tore the  ring out of his lip, and told him he and his gang had better stop bothering this guy or they would have to deal with me!”\n“Wow that’s impressive, “When did this happen?”\n“About three minutes ago,” came the reply.\n", "comments_count": 12, "id": 5, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "112", "category_id": "113", "subcategory_name": "Good Jokes", "category_name": "Best Jokes"}, {"subcategory_id": "116", "category_id": "114", "subcategory_name": "Heaven Jokes", "category_name": "Death Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}]}
