There must be a way for you to go cheaper.” “Well,” said the Dentist thoughtfully, I suppose if we don’t numb it, we could knock off $30.” “Only $30?,” countered Sally, “that’s still $100, you’ve got to make it cheaper.” “Well,” said the Dentist after a long pause, “I suppose if we take it out with a wrench we could knock it down to $50.” “Perfect”, said Sally happily. “I would like to make an appointment for next Tuesday, for my husband Jack.”", "comments_count": 6, "id": 62, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "122", "category_id": "116", "subcategory_name": "Medical Jokes", "category_name": "Doctor Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "159", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Husband Wife Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "162", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Relationship Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "164", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Wife Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}]}
