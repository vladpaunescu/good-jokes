He just needed to try some pork, just to see what it tasted like. So one summer day he told his members he was going on a vacation. He packed out of town, and headed to the nearest restaurant. After sitting down, he ordered a roasted pig, and impatiently waited for his delicacy.\nAfter just a few minutes, he heard someone call his name, and to his great chagrin he saw one of his fellow members walking towards him. Just at that same moment, the waiter walked over, with a huge platter, holding a full roasted pig with an apple in it’s mouth.\n“Isn’t that something,” says the leader after only a moments pause, “all I do is order an apple, and look what it comes with!”\n", "comments_count": 4, "id": 299, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "150", "category_id": "122", "subcategory_name": "Food Jokes", "category_name": "Life Jokes"}, {"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}, {"subcategory_id": "199", "category_id": "133", "subcategory_name": "Clever Jokes", "category_name": "Witty Jokes"}]}
