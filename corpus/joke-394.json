He saved the biggest for last, so it took a while until he got to opening Grandma’s present. “Wow” Timmy exclaimed in delight, upon seeing the mini drum set that his Grandmother got for him. “Thanks Grandma this is just what I wanted.” It was after Timmy went to bed that Timmy’s mother approached her mother. “Ma, I’m surprised at you, don’t you remember how it used to drive you crazy when we used to play the drums in the house growing up?” Grandma smiled and then said “I remember, of course I remember.” ", "comments_count": 2, "id": 395, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "168", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Funny Stories", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}]}
