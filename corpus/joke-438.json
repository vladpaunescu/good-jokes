While he was paying it up, along with the interest of $11 dollars, the manager came over, “sir, we are very happy to have you’re business, but if you don’t mind me asking, after you left we looked into you and found out that you are a millionaire, why would you need to borrow $4000 dollars?”   \n“Well, the fellow responded it’s quite simple, where else can I park my car for three weeks in New York for $11 dollars?” \n", "comments_count": 5, "id": 439, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}, {"subcategory_id": "199", "category_id": "133", "subcategory_name": "Clever Jokes", "category_name": "Witty Jokes"}]}
