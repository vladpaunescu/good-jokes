Next was Tom “I played with Jessica in the sand box.” “OK, let me see you write the word ‘sand’ on the board.” He did and got a lollipop.
The next one was Billy Goldberg “Well”, Billy said, “I tried to play in the sand box, but Jessica and Tom threw rocks at me.” “What?” The Teacher said “they threw rocks at you that sounds like outright anti semitism to me. If you can write ‘outright antisemitism’ on the board you’ll get a lollipop!”
