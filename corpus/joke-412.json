Here look at this” he said pulling out his check book, “look I wrote out a check for the full $150,000!” \n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 442, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}, {"subcategory_id": "199", "category_id": "133", "subcategory_name": "Clever Jokes", "category_name": "Witty Jokes"}, {"subcategory_id": "202", "category_id": "134", "subcategory_name": "Lawyer Jokes", "category_name": "Work Humor"}]}
