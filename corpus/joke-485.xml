But what she answered he just couldn’t seem to remember.  Morton picked up the phone and dialed.  ”Hi Greta”, said Morton, “I have a funny question for you, do you remember last night when I proposed?”  ”Oh my gosh” gushed Greta, “I’m so glad you called, I knew I said yes to somebody but I just couldn’t recall who it was!”
