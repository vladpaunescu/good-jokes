You’ve been sitting at your desk looking depressed for the last five minutes!” “Oh Dan,” responded Brian “I don’t know what to do! I got in a big fight last night with my Suzie, she claims I never buy her gifts, so I must not care about her!”\n“Brian, that’s horrible!” said Dan putting his arm around Brian. “What type of a gift does she want already?”\n“Well, right before she closed the door on my face she said to me: “Why don’t you show me how much you care about me? Why can’t you get me something that goes from 0 to 175 in seconds!”\n“Dan what should I do? I don’t have that kind of money? I can’t go out and buy her a car!”\n“A car? Asked Dan. “Who needs a car? Just stop by Target and buy her a scale!”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 328, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "158", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Husband Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "159", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Husband Wife Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "162", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Relationship Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "174", "category_id": "125", "subcategory_name": "Men Jokes", "category_name": "People Jokes"}]}
