As he was speaking to his young granddaughter Emily, Edward suddenly smelled an all too familiar smell.  Why it was his favorite – apple pie!  His wife Sandy must have been baking it for him to enjoy this one last time.  “Emily dear,” asked Edward.  “Would you please go ask Grandma for a slice of that Apple Pie?  It’s smells so delicious!”  Emily ran off to fulfill her dying Grandfather’s last wish.  A moment later, Emily returned empty handed.  “Where’s my pie?”  questioned Edward.  “Grandma said it’s not for now” responded Emily, “it’s for the funeral”.\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 16, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "114", "category_id": "114", "subcategory_name": "Death Jokes", "category_name": "Death Humor"}]}
