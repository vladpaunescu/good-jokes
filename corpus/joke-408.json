As he tried walking  into the restaurant he got stopped at the door, “sorry no pets allowed.” Can’t you see” said Jim “I am blind, this is my seeing eye dog.” \nBut it’s a doberman pincher, who uses a doberman pincher as a seeing eye dog?” the man asked “Oh,” Jim responded “you must have not heard, this is the latest type of seeing eye dog, they do a very good job.” \nSeeing that it worked,  John tried walking in with his Chihuahua. Even before he could open his mouth, the doorman said “don’t tell me that a Chihuahua is the latest type of seeing eye dog.”\nThinking quickly John responded in a angry voice “You mean they gave me a Chihuahua?” \n", "comments_count": 7, "id": 438, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}, {"subcategory_id": "199", "category_id": "133", "subcategory_name": "Clever Jokes", "category_name": "Witty Jokes"}]}
