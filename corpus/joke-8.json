The family called Marvin’s Preacher to be with him in his final moments. As the Preacher stood by the bed, Marvin’s condition seemed to deteriorate, and Marvin motioned for someone to quickly pass him a pen and paper. The Preacher quickly got a pen and paper and lovingly handed it to Marvin. But before he had a chance to read the note, Marvin died. The Preacher feeling that now wasn’t the right time to read it put the note in his jacket pocket. It was at the funeral while speaking that the Preacher suddenly remembered the note. Reaching deep into his pocket the Preacher said “and you know what, I suddenly remembered that right before Marvin died he handed me a note, and knowing Marvin I’m sure it was something inspiring that we can all gain from. With that introduction the Preacher ripped out the note and opened it.\nThe note said “HEY, YOU ARE STANDING ON MY OXYGEN TUBE!”\n", "comments_count": 19, "id": 9, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "112", "category_id": "113", "subcategory_name": "Good Jokes", "category_name": "Best Jokes"}, {"subcategory_id": "114", "category_id": "114", "subcategory_name": "Death Jokes", "category_name": "Death Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "115", "category_id": "114", "subcategory_name": "Funeral Jokes", "category_name": "Death Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "167", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Funny Speech Openers", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}, {"subcategory_id": "171", "category_id": "124", "subcategory_name": "Long Jokes", "category_name": "Other Joke Types"}]}
