If you meet a fellow named John Dun, tell him to call his wife.” Jim happily complied and was on his way. He was barely in America for a hour when he saw a big building with the words Dun Watches, “Wow!” thought Jim “that was easy.” Jim walked into the building and asked the lady behind the desk “do you have a John here?” “Second door on the left,” was her reply. Jim saw a man walking out of the door drying his hands “are you Dun?” he asked. “Yes” came the mystified reply. “Call your wife,” said Jim, “she’s been waiting to hear from you.”</content><comments_count type="str">3</comments_count><id type="str">364</id><categories type="list"><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">162</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">123</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Relationship Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Marriage Humor</category_name></item></categories></root>
