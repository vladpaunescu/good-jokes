It was after a few days that it struck me that they seemed nervous about it. After talking it over with them I finally figured out the problem. They thought they would each have to fly on a separate plane by themselves. How else would we all fit into one of those tiny planes that fly in the sky?</content><comments_count type="str">0</comments_count><id type="str">317</id><categories type="list"><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">153</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">122</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Little Johnny Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Life Jokes</category_name></item><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">171</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">124</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Long Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">Other Joke Types</category_name></item><item type="dict"><subcategory_id type="str">173</subcategory_id><category_id type="str">125</category_id><subcategory_name type="str">Cute Jokes</subcategory_name><category_name type="str">People Jokes</category_name></item></categories></root>
