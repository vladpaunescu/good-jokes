But no matter how hard he tried, his reputation as someone who was not dedicated to the job, seemed to follow him around.\nOne day the phone rang at his office. Although Bob did not usually pick up the phone, he picked it up and said hello. “Hi” said the man on the line, “I have an unusual question to ask you, I’m looking into a fellow Bob Smith for a position in my company. Do you know this fellow?”\n“Sure I know him”, responded Bob with a smile.\n“Tell me,” asked the man. “Is he consistent with his work? Does he always show up on time?”\n“Well I’ll be honest with you” Bob truthfully replied, “I’m not so consistent myself, but whenever I’m here he’s here!”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 561, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "199", "category_id": "133", "subcategory_name": "Clever Jokes", "category_name": "Witty Jokes"}, {"subcategory_id": "204", "category_id": "134", "subcategory_name": "Work Jokes", "category_name": "Work Humor"}]}
