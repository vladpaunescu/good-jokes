Why you must be 60 already but you don’t look a day over 40!” Rob exclaimed.  \n“I feel like I’m 40 too!” replied John.  \n“That’s incredible” exclaimed Rob, “Does it run in the family?  How old was your dad when he passed?”  \n“Did I say he was dead?” asked John.  “He’s 81 and is more active then ever.  He just joined the neighborhood basketball team!” responded John.  \n“Whoa!  Well how old was your Grandfather when he died?”  \n“Did I say he died” asked John.  Rob was amazed.  “He just had his 105th birthday and plays golf and goes swimming each day!  He’s actually getting married this week!” \n“Getting married?!” Rob asked.  If he’s 105, why on earth does he want to get married?!  \nJohn looked at Rob and replied, “Did I say he wanted to?”\n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 515, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "190", "category_id": "130", "subcategory_name": "Old People Jokes", "category_name": "Senior Jokes"}]}
