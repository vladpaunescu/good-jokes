It was a nice way to pass the time and the men enjoyed it immensely.\nJohn’s wife wasn’t so fond of her husband’s poker playing.  She thought it was a dirty and low way to fill his time, but she had long ago resigned herself to her sorry fate, although inside of her, there was  always a low flame on the back burner waiting to erupt.\nOne Wednesday night, after a few nights of boring games, something exciting happened.  Sam watched in amusement as John and Abe, each convinced that they had the better hand,  slowly put their life savings into the pot. Things started to get really intense when John, running out of available cash, added  his car and house into the pot.\nWhen there was no money left to bet on they each showed their cards.  As soon as John saw Abe’s cards and realized he had lost, he had a heart attack and died.\n“Sam,” asked Abe “how are we going to tell his wife?” “Don’t worry I’ll take care of it” Abe replied.\nAbe knocked on John’s door. “John just lost all of your life savings in a poker game,” said Sam when the door was opened. “He’s afraid to come home.”\nJohn’s wife was fuming “HE DID WHAT?!” She screamed. “TELL HIM I DON’T WANT TO EVER SEE HIS FACE AGAIN! TELL HIM TO JUST DROP DEAD!”\n“Ok,” said Sam nodding his head, “I’ll tell him just that!”\n \n \n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 343, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "159", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Husband Wife Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}, {"subcategory_id": "161", "category_id": "123", "subcategory_name": "Marriage Jokes", "category_name": "Marriage Humor"}]}
