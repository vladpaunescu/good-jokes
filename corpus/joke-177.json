Seeing this the bartender picks him up and throws him out of the bar. The string walks over to a curb rubs himself against it and ties himself in a knot, then walks back into the bar. “Excuse me, can I please have a drink?” “Aren’t you the string that was just here?” asks the bartender. “No” came the answer, “I’m a frayed knot.” \n", "comments_count": 0, "id": 195, "categories": [{"subcategory_id": "139", "category_id": "121", "subcategory_name": "Cheesy Jokes", "category_name": "Kids Jokes"}]}
